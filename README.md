OBITT - OpenCV Barcode Inventory Tracking Technology



In a rapidly evolving industrial landscape, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face unique challenges in managing diverse product inventories efficiently and cost-effectively. This project proposes a **Smart Inventory Management System** leveraging OpenCV, Raspberry Pi, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to revolutionize inventory tracking for SMEs.

**The Problem:**  
Traditional inventory systems in SMEs are plagued by inefficiencies:
- Manual tracking leads to errors, delays, and increased labor costs.
- Over- or under-stocking results in financial losses.
- High setup costs of RFID and other advanced systems limit adoption.

**The Solution (in progress):**  
Our solution automates inventory management through real-time image recognition using OpenCV, paired with affordable hardware like Raspberry Pi. Key features include:
1. **Real-Time Barcode/QR Code Recognition:** Automates data capture with high accuracy and efficiency.
2. **OCR Integration:** Processes product labels to extract and classify information seamlessly.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Eliminates the need for expensive RFID systems, making it accessible for SMEs.
4. **Scalability:** Easily integrates with other IoT devices for broader applications in smart factory environments.
5. **Data Visualization:** Monitors inventory status through a user-friendly web interface or mobile app.

**Technological Advantages:**  
- Uses lightweight hardware with optimized software for fast, efficient operations.
- OpenCV and ZBar libraries ensure robust recognition in diverse environments.
- Raspberry Piâ€™s modular design allows flexible deployment and easy upgrades.

**Impact:**  
- Streamlines inventory management, reducing errors and operational costs.
- Supports SMEs in transitioning towards Industry 4.0 by providing a scalable and affordable solution.
- Enables real-time decision-making through data-driven insights.
