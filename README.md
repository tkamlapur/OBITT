OBITT - OpenCV Barcode Inventory Tracking Technology

In a rapidly evolving industrial landscape, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face unique challenges in managing diverse product inventories efficiently and cost-effectively. This project proposes a Smart Inventory Management System leveraging OpenCV, Raspberry Pi, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to revolutionize inventory tracking for SMEs.

The Problem:
Traditional inventory systems in SMEs are plagued by inefficiencies:

Manual tracking leads to errors, delays, and increased labor costs.
Over- or under-stocking results in financial losses.
High setup costs of RFID and other advanced systems limit adoption.
The Solution:
Our solution automates inventory management through real-time image recognition using OpenCV, paired with affordable hardware like Raspberry Pi. Key features include:

Real-Time Barcode/QR Code Recognition: Automates data capture with high accuracy and efficiency.
OCR Integration: Processes product labels to extract and classify information seamlessly.
Cost-Effectiveness: Eliminates the need for expensive RFID systems, making it accessible for SMEs.
Scalability: Easily integrates with other IoT devices for broader applications in smart factory environments.
Data Visualization: Monitors inventory status through a user-friendly web interface or mobile app.
Technological Advantages:

Uses lightweight hardware with optimized software for fast, efficient operations.
OpenCV and ZBar libraries ensure robust recognition in diverse environments.
Raspberry Piâ€™s modular design allows flexible deployment and easy upgrades.
Impact:

Streamlines inventory management, reducing errors and operational costs.
Supports SMEs in transitioning towards Industry 4.0 by providing a scalable and affordable solution.
Enables real-time decision-making through data-driven insights.
This system not only addresses the current inefficiencies in inventory management but also aligns with the global push towards sustainable and smart manufacturing practices. With a focus on accessibility and affordability, it empowers SMEs to compete effectively in an increasingly digitalized market.
